Details for the day
-------------------

Two hack nights: on [12th September][event-1] and [26th September][event-2] 2013, from 7.15pm.

Come help create a multi-player Text Adventure. We’ll start with text and a storyline, and then add pictures to the scenes.

Non-programmers are welcome - we need ideas, words, artwork, design and all sorts of creativity…

And programmers - we’ll be using JavaScript and Node.js, so come and lend your loops to the task.

This a chance to work with others on a creative group project. There are two sessions: 12th Sept and 26th Sept. Feel free to come to both or either.

WRITERS: Write inspiring descriptions of rooms, items and beings…  
ARTISTS: Bring beauty to the world…  
PROGRAMMERS: Extend our super simple game engine; maybe add interactions between players and other niceties.  
EVERYONE: Help us create a new world!
