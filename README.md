Come help create a multi-player Text Adventure. We'll start with text and a storyline, and then maybe add pictures to the scenes.

Non-programmers are welcome - we need ideas, words, artwork, design and all sorts of creativity...

And programmers - we'll be using JavaScript and Node.js, so come and lend your closures and variables to the task.It's fine if you don't know Node.js or if you've never coded before; come along and learn a bit with the rest of us.

A chance to work with others on a creative group project. It's great if you can come for the whole day, but feel free to pop in at any time.

 - WRITERS: Write inspiring descriptions of rooms, items and beings...     
 - ARTISTS: Bring beauty to the world...
 - PROGRAMMERS: Extend our super simple game engine; maybe add interactions between players and other niceties.
 - EVERYONE: Help us create a new world! Free, as in entry.
