A multiplayer [text adventure][text-adventure], created together at [Async][async] in Brighton at the [Lab for the Recently Possible][l4rp].

Now returning 10 years later in 2023 for a new generation of Async.JS!

Getting started
---------------

See the [Nodeventure wiki][wiki].


Details for the day
-------------------

Two hack nights: on [4th May][event-1] and [11th May][event-2] 2023, from 7.15pm.

Come help create a multi-player Text Adventure. We’ll start with text and a storyline, and then add pictures to the scenes.

Non-programmers are welcome - we need ideas, words, artwork, design and all sorts of creativity…

And programmers - we’ll be using JavaScript and Node.js, so come and lend your loops to the task.

This a chance to work with others on a creative group project. There are two sessions: 4th May and 11th May. Feel free to come to either or (better yet!) both.

WRITERS: Write inspiring descriptions of rooms, items and beings…  
ARTISTS: Bring beauty to the world…  
PROGRAMMERS: Extend our super simple game engine; maybe add interactions between players and other niceties.  
EVERYONE: Help us create a new world!
